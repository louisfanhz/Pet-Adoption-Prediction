# Pet Adoption Prediction

This project utilize the powerful and versatile functionalities provided by sklearn and xgboost packages to explore various machine learning models on our
particular classification problem (Proper citation can be found in the project report). It also examine the effect of regularization and different data engineering
technique on the prediction score. We use accuracy score and ROC as our evaluation metric.

All code block within Pet_Adoption_Prediction.ipynb can be run directly given that the dataset is already included in this repo.

The dataset is provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction) and PetFinder.my, a Malaysian 
animal welfare platform. Hopefully the prediction could provide insight into the factors that are most important in determining whether or not an 
animal will be adopted, which could help shelters and rescue organizations make more informed decisions about how to care for and promote their animals.
